In this module, we will discuss the integration
of artisanal and local made-by-hand design and craftsmanship into
the design process. Through the lens of 20th
century pop culture, we'll find out how surface
pattern design has reverberated through the fashion of the last century and
into this millennium. You will learn about
fashions architects, including Cristobal
Balenciaga and his undisputed role in fashion
during the 1950s and 60s, as well as the impact of his
design DNA on fashion today. We will also discuss
provenance and heritage and ask who owns an idea and where does homage crossover
into appropriation. You will then learn how fashion is based upon creating a design aesthetic that is easily recognizable and
establishes a range of materials that will become identifiable with your brand. You will also realize that by establishing a
silhouette and fits, you'll create your brand
signature. Let's begin.
